# Circle_Packaging
Generic R function for the estimation of a circle packing in a cricle.

The circle pacaging is based on equation:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=P = pi/(0.7175*(R/r)^0.0529)">

P was established based on power trendline of circle density from http://www.packomania.com/
