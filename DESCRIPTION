Description: Generic function for the estimation of a circle packing in a circle.
  The circle pacaging is based on equation: \deqn{Circle_no = (pi * R^2)/(P * r^2)}
  Where \deqn{P = pi/(0.7175*(R/r)^0.0529)}
  P was established based on power trendline of circle density from \url{http://www.packomania.com/}.
